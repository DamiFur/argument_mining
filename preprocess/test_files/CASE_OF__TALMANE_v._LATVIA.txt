In the case of Talmane v. Latvia,
The European Court of Human Rights (Fifth Section), sitting as a Chamber composed of:
Angelika Nußberger,  President, Khanlar Hajiyev, Erik Møse, Faris Vehabović, Yonko Grozev, Carlo Ranzoni, Mārtiņš Mits,  judges, and Milan Blaško,  Deputy Section Registrar,
Having deliberated in private on 20 September 2016,
Delivers the following judgment, which was adopted on that date:
PROCEDURE
1.  The case originated in an application (no. 47938/07) against the Republic of Latvia lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by a Russian national, Ms Lilija Talmane (“the applicant”), on 10 October 2007.
2.  The applicant was represented by Ms E. Kalniņa, a lawyer practising in Riga. The Latvian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agents, Mrs I. Reine, and subsequently Mrs K. Līce.
3.  The applicant alleged that the refusal of the Senate of the Supreme Court to examine her appeal on points of law without a reasoned decision infringed her right to a fair hearing.
4.  On 15 January 2009 the above complaint was communicated to the Government of the Republic of Latvia. The Government of the Russian Federation did not exercise their right to intervene in the above case as a third party.
THE FACTS
...
THE LAW
I.  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION ON ACCOUNT OF THE LACK OF A REASONED DECISION
18.  The applicant complained that the refusal of the Senate of the Supreme Court to examine her appeal on points of law without a reasoned decision infringed her right to a fair hearing as provided in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, which in its relevant part reads as follows:
“In the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by [a] ... tribunal ...”
A.  Admissibility
1.  The parties’ submissions
19.  The Government argued that the applicant had failed to exhaust domestic remedies. Specifically, she had not asked the prosecutor to lodge an appeal ( protests ) against the judgment of 13 February 2007, as provided for under chapter 63 of the Criminal Procedure Law, which set out conditions for the review of judgments and decisions which have entered into force (see paragraph 13 above).
20.  The applicant did not comment on this matter.
2.  The Court’s assessment
21.  According to the Court’s case-law, the applicants are only obliged to use an effective remedy that is actually available in theory and in practice at the relevant time (see, among other authorities,  Sejdovic v. Italy  [GC], no. 56581/00, § 46, ECHR 2006‑II). It follows that Article 35 § 1 of the Convention does not require that discretionary or extraordinary remedies be exhausted (see, among other authorities,  Babayev v. Azerbaijan  (dec.), no. 36454/03, 27 May 2004).
22.  In the case of  Dāvidsons and Savins   v. Latvia , nos. 17574/07 and 25235/07, § 36, 7 January 2016, the Court already assessed an identical argument raised by the Government and found that the review procedure enshrined in chapter 63 of the Criminal Procedure Law constituted an extraordinary remedy.
23.  The aforementioned suffices to conclude that this procedure cannot be taken into account for the purposes of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention. The Government’s objection must therefore be rejected.
24.  The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.
